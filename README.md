# c-minus-compiler
A compiler I made for a compiler construction course. It goes from c- to TM, both provided by the instructor for that course.

I DID NOT WRITE: emitcode.cpp, emitcode.h, getopt.cpp, getopt.h, symbolTable.cpp, symbolTable.h, yyerror.cpp, yyerror.h.
These files were provided by the instructor of the course, Robert Heckendorn.
